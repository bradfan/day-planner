We were to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

It compares the current time to assigned tasks on the planner and changes color depending on past, present or future. 

There was a great deal of collaberation with many students. I used a lot of resources from the training repo and my go to's for info is still W3 Schools and MDN but I may have consulted StackOverflow or others. Instructors and TA's, as always, were a tremendous resource on a difficult assignment.
